Emboldened by your recent success with caring for a stray horse you found, you
decide to open a horse shelter for horses in need of a home.

First you will need to name your horse shelter.

Each round the game will print a table with the stats for all the horses in your shelter.
These stats/needs will range from 1-10. When a horse's sleepiness gets above 8, it will
fall asleep.
The game will present you with 6 options:

1. Take in a new horse - add a new horse to the shelter by entering it's name 
and description

2. Adopt out a horse - remove a horse from the shelter by entering it's name

3. Feed the horses - feed all the horses in the shelter

4. Water the horses - water all the horses in the shelter

5. Play with a horse - Enter a horse's name to play with it and lower it's boredom 
(the horse will be more tired after)

6. Move a horse to the barn or pasture - Enter the name of the horse you'd like to move

7. Do nothing - (Time will still pass)

8. Quit the game.
